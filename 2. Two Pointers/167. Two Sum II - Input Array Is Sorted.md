  ### 문제

  Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

  Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

  The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

  Your solution must use only constant extra space.

  ```python
  class Solution:
      def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
          start, end = 0, len(numbers)-1
          while start < end:
              if numbers[start] + numbers[end] == target:
                  return [start+1, end+1]
              elif numbers[start] + numbers[end] < target:
                  start += 1
              else:
                  end -= 1
  ```
